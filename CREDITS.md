## Dependency details

We also thank the authors of the many supporting and transitive dependencies
that these projects rely on. This is a curated acknowledgment, rather than a
complete dependency inventory. Direct dependencies are recorded in the
[root](package.json), [frontend](frontend/package.json),
[backend](backend/package.json), and [Word add-in](word-addin/package.json)
package manifests; their lockfiles record resolved JavaScript dependencies.
The [Compose stack](docker-compose.yml) and application Dockerfiles also record
system and service dependencies.

Each third-party project retains its own license and copyright notices. Refer
to the license and notice files distributed with the versions in use. Please
keep this page current when adding or replacing a significant dependency.
