# One-time move of a Compose volume created before the migration ledger
# (backend/migrations/20261010_06_schema_migrations.sql) onto it. Run by
# db-init only when the volume has a schema but no public.schema_migrations.
#
# Before the ledger, db-init could not tell what a volume had applied, so
# every start replayed each migration from 20260823_01 to 20261010_05. A
# failure up to 20260921_01 was ignored (most of those files cannot run a
# second time over their own result), one from 20260921_02 on stopped the
# start, and 20260905_01 was skipped once memory_files existed. This script
# does that replay one last time under the same rules, so a volume last
# started on any older checkout catches up exactly as it used to, then
# records everything up to 20261010_05 as applied. Later files are left to
# `migrate.sh up`.
#
# Environment: DB and MIGRATIONS_DIR as in db-init, and MIGRATE_SH, the path
# of backend/scripts/migrate.sh (default /migrate.sh).
