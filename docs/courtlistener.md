# CourtListener integration

Mike can use CourtListener for US case-law citation verification, case fetching,
targeted opinion search, and case-law panels in assistant responses.

## Enable live access

Set `COURTLISTENER_API_TOKEN` in `backend/.env` and restart the backend. When an
instance does not provide a global token, users can add their own under
**Settings > API Keys**.

Fresh databases created from `backend/schema.sql` already include the required
CourtListener tables. Existing deployments must apply the matching dated
migration from `backend/migrations/` before enabling the integration.

Live requests remain subject to CourtListener's API limits.

## Optional bulk data

Set `COURTLISTENER_BULK_DATA_ENABLED=true` to make Mike try local Postgres and
R2 data before falling back to CourtListener's API:

- Citation metadata is read from `public.courtlistener_citation_index`.
- Case-cluster metadata is read from
  `public.courtlistener_opinion_cluster_index`.
- Cached opinion JSON is read from
  `courtlistener/opinions/by-cluster/{clusterId}/{opinionId}.json` in R2.

If bulk data has not been imported, leave
`COURTLISTENER_BULK_DATA_ENABLED=false`. Live CourtListener tools still work
with a valid token.

## Troubleshooting

If tools report a missing token, confirm `COURTLISTENER_API_TOKEN` is present
in `backend/.env` or add a user token, then restart the backend after changing
the environment.

If bulk lookup does not return local results, confirm that:

- `COURTLISTENER_BULK_DATA_ENABLED=true`;
- both CourtListener index tables contain data; and
- opinion JSON exists beneath `courtlistener/opinions/by-cluster/` in R2.

Mike falls back to the live API when local bulk data is unavailable and a token
is configured.
