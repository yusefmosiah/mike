# Backend architecture

The Express backend in `backend/` is organized as **domain modules over a
shared kernel**. This page is the reference for that layout: what goes where,
the rules that keep the layers honest, and the test that enforces them.

```
backend/src/
├── app.ts                 Express app: middleware, rate limits, mounts one router per module

```

## Module anatomy

Every directory under `src/modules/` follows the same shape — a *service-only
module*, described after the table, is the one shape without a routes file:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `<name>.routes.ts` | **HTTP layer.** Parses params/query/body, calls service functions, maps their typed results onto status codes and JSON. Never queries the database. |
| `<name>.service.ts` | **Facade.** The module's public surface: named re-exports of the functions other code may call. Exactly one per module. Small modules put the implementation here directly. |
| `<name>.<topic>.ts` | **Service topic files** (large modules only). Business logic and data access for one topic: `documents.versions.ts`, `user.profile.ts`, `tabular.chats.ts`… Take an explicit `db: Db`, return typed results, never touch `req`/`res`. |
| `<name>.shared.ts` | Types and helpers shared by the module's topic files but not exported through the facade. |
| `__tests__/` | Unit tests for the service functions (fake `db`), colocated with the code. |

A **service-only module** — an internal service other backend code calls
directly, with no HTTP surface of its own — keeps this shape minus
`<name>.routes.ts`. `retrieval` is the example: chunking, indexing, and hybrid
search for chat context assembly. There is nothing for `app.ts` to mount, so
the facade is the module's whole outward surface; it must be listed in the
route-less exemption in `architecture.test.ts` with a comment explaining why.
Reach for this only when no route is coming — a new HTTP surface is a new
module with a routes file.

Streaming endpoints are the one place HTTP leaks into the module body: SSE
loops (header flush, LLM stream, stop handling, assistant-message
persistence) stay in the routes file because stream lifetime *is* an HTTP
concern. Only their pre-stream preparation and post-stream persistence live in
the service. `tabular.generateStream.ts` is the single sanctioned exception
that takes `res` directly, because two routes share its *async* stream; its
header says so. Its synchronous half takes a `write` function instead — that
generation is a server-owned run, so the frames belong to the run, not to one
response.

### Server-owned runs

A *run* (`lib/streamRuns.ts`) is a generation the server owns rather than the
HTTP response that asked for it. The route registers one, writes frames into
it, and any number of responses attach: the original request, a reload, a
second tab. `write` appends to the run's frame buffer and fans out to every
attached response, `signal` aborts only on an explicit stop, and closing a
response merely detaches it. Each frame carries an SSE `id:` line with its
sequence number, which is what a client sends back as `from` when it
reconnects. A frame written with `{ replay: () => …}` still fans out live but
is replayed to a late subscriber only while the predicate holds. A run is
registered under a `key` — what may only have one run at a time — and carries
an opaque `meta` for the surface that owns it.

An SSE **comment** line (`: tool-wait`) written through `write` fans out live
but is never buffered or numbered: it is a keep-alive, so replaying it to a
late subscriber would be noise and would move every real frame's sequence
number.

Every streaming surface uses it.

#### Chat turns

The chat and project-chat streams (`POST /chat`, `POST /projects/:id/chat`)
register a run per assistant turn through `lib/assistantTurnRuns.ts`, the
chat-shaped view of the registry (key `<surface>:<chatId>`, the assistant row
id in `meta`). `attachAssistantTurnSse(res, run)` hands back the same
`{ signal, write, finish }` the older `openAssistantSse` did.

- `GET /chat/:chatId/turn/:turnId/stream?from=<seq>` attaches to a run (a
  reload, a second tab, a dropped connection): frames with `seq >= from` are
  replayed, then the live ones follow until the run ends. Visibility on the
  chat is enough, as it is for reading the transcript.
- `POST /chat/:chatId/turn/:turnId/stop` is the one way to cut a generation
  short; it needs the standing that sending does. The route's abort path
  then persists the partial answer labelled "Cancelled by user." and writes
  a `cancelled` frame before `[DONE]`, so attached readers learn the outcome.
- `GET /chat/:chatId` reports `active_turn` (`{ id, seq, assistant_message_id }`)
  while a run is generating, which is how a freshly loaded client knows to
  attach rather than treat the hidden reservation row as "no answer".
- A chat has at most one run at a time: a second `POST` while one is
  generating answers `409 turn_in_progress`.

#### Tabular review chat

`POST /tabular-review/:reviewId/chat` registers the same kind of run under the
`tabular` surface (key `tabular:<chatId>`), so the two surfaces cannot collide
on a shared id and a lookup by turn id is scoped to the surface that asked.
The endpoints mirror chat's, with the tabular access model: seeing the review
is enough to attach, and stopping needs what writing the thread needs (review
chats are creator-write).

- `GET /tabular-review/:reviewId/chats/:chatId/turn/:turnId/stream?from=<seq>`
- `POST /tabular-review/:reviewId/chats/:chatId/turn/:turnId/stop`
- `GET /tabular-review/:reviewId/chats` reports `active_turn` per row, which
  is how a panel that has just loaded knows to attach. The messages endpoint
  keeps its bare array: it is the transcript, and the running turn is not in
  it yet.
- A second `POST /chat` into the same thread answers `409 turn_in_progress`.

`prepareTabularChat` is allowed to return no chat id, and a request with no
thread to key a run on keeps the old single-socket contract — nothing could
ever attach to it.

#### Tabular review generation

`POST /tabular-review/:reviewId/generate` on the synchronous path (the
default; `ASYNC_TABULAR_EXTRACTION=true` uses BullMQ workers instead, whose
durability comes from the queue) registers a run keyed `review:<reviewId>` as
soon as it has claimed the generation lease. From then on a closed socket is a
detach: the extraction keeps filling cells, the lease stays held, and the
frames wait in the run for whoever attaches next. The pre-lease guards are
still tied to the request — nothing is claimed yet, so a caller that walks
away costs nothing.

- `GET /tabular-review/:reviewId/generate/stream?from=<seq>` attaches to the
  run when this process has one, replaying `cell_update` frames from `from`
  (replaying them is idempotent) and then tailing. With no in-process run — the
  async path, another replica, a lease with nothing attached — it falls back
  to the DB-tailing view it always was. A review *viewer* is refused, as at
  `POST /generate`.
- `POST /tabular-review/:reviewId/generate/stop` is the one way to cut a
  synchronous generation short; closing the socket no longer does it. The
  stopped cells go back to `pending` and readers get a `cancelled` frame
  before `[DONE]`. With no in-process run it answers
  `404 generation_not_found`, which is also what an async-path deployment
  answers — there the work belongs to the queue.
- `GET /tabular-review/:reviewId` reports `active_generation`
  (`{ id, seq }`) while this process is generating. That is the stronger,
  *stoppable* statement; `review.is_running` (the database lease) stays and is
  also true for an async or another replica's run.
- A second `POST /generate` while a run is still streaming answers
  `409 review_running`, handing back the lease it had just claimed.

#### Word chat

`POST /word-chat` registers a run under the `word` surface. `chatId` always
exists by then — a cloud row's id, or the UUID `prepareWordChatStream` mints
for `storage: "local"` — so every Word turn is keyed and attachable, local
ones included.

- `GET /word-chat/:chatId/turn/:turnId/stream?document_id=<uuid>&from=<seq>`
- `POST /word-chat/:chatId/turn/:turnId/stop?document_id=<uuid>`
- `GET /word-chat/:chatId` reports `active_turn`. Note that it filters the
  reserved (still-empty) assistant row out of `messages`, so a turn in flight
  is visible ONLY as `active_turn` and a reattaching pane appends its own
  placeholder.
- A second `POST /word-chat` into the same chat answers
  `409 turn_in_progress`.

Both endpoints authorise **from the run**: `run.userId` must be the caller and
the run's `clientDocumentId` must be the `document_id` presented, otherwise
`404 turn_not_found`. A local chat is never persisted, so there is no row to
authorise against — and a cloud chat's row says nothing about which run is
live either.

Client tool calls need two things of the registry, both in `streamRuns.ts`:
the adapter's `: tool-wait` keep-alives are comments, so they fan out live and
are never buffered or numbered; and a `client_tool_call` frame is written with
`{ replay: () => isClientToolCallPending(callId) }`, so a pane that reattaches
while the call is outstanding is handed it and can answer the tool loop that
is still waiting, while a call that has been answered, timed out (60 s) or
cancelled is never replayed. Two panes attached at once would both execute a
replayed call; the first result settles the bridge and the second is dropped
by `submitClientToolResult`, but the document work has already happened twice.

Runs live in process memory. A finished run is retained for
`FINISHED_RUN_RETENTION_MS` (60 s) so a late reconnect still gets the
terminal frames, and a run that outlives `MAX_RUN_LIFETIME_MS` (30 min) is
stopped as a safety net. A resume therefore has to reach the replica that is
generating: run one replica, or route by session, until the buffer is moved
to shared storage. `lib/assistantSse.ts` (`openAssistantSse`) survives only
for the one case that cannot be a run: a tabular review chat whose
preparation produced no chat id, so there is no key to register under and
nothing that could ever attach.

#### Restarts

A run dies with its process; the turn behind it need not. Each route hands
`runLLMStream` a `durableTurn` context (the request minus its history, JSON
only), which Pi stores with the turn until the outcome is saved
(`finishTurn`). On boot `src/turnResumers.ts` reads `interruptedTurns()` and
gives each turn to the resumer its context's `surface` names: chat,
project-chat, word or tabular. The resumer rebuilds the turn from storage the
way its request would (access checked again, documents and grid reloaded,
nothing inserted), registers a fresh run under the same turn id, and drives
it; a client finds that run through `active_turn` and attaches as usual. Pi
replays read tools and answers interrupted writes as interrupted, so nothing
is written twice. A turn that can no longer be driven (access gone, chat
deleted, the conversation moved on) is abandoned and its answer row says why.

Only turns whose transcript lives in Mike's database are durable: a
`storage: "local"` Word chat keeps nothing server-side, so its interrupted run
is simply stopped. Review chats store the answer row at the end rather than
reserving it, so an abandoned review-chat turn gets an error answer inserted
under its prompt.

### The service contract

A service function takes the database handle first (`db: Db`, exported from
`lib/db/`: a chainable query builder over a direct Postgres connection), then request-derived primitives, and
returns a
discriminated union rather than throwing or writing a response:

```ts
export async function renameFolder(
  db: Db,
  args: { userId: string; folderId: string; name: string },
): Promise<ServiceResult<Folder>> {
  if (!args.name.trim()) return failure("validation", "name is required");
  const { data, error } = await db.from("folders").update(/* … */);
  if (error) return internalFailure(error);
  if (!data) return failure("not_found", "Folder not found");
  return ok(data);
}
```

The route maps the failure with `sendServiceFailure(res, result)`, so the
status-code policy (`validation` → 400, `forbidden` → 403, `not_found` → 404,
`conflict` → 409, `unavailable` → 503, `error` → 500 via `sendInternalError`)
lives in one file: `lib/serviceResult.ts`. Modules that predate the contract
carry their own `kind` strings with equivalent mappings in their routes file;
new code uses the shared one.

## The rules

1. **`lib/` never imports from `modules/`.** The kernel does not know which
   domains exist. There are no dependency exceptions.
2. **A module is reached from outside only through its facade.** Another
   module, a worker, a job, `app.ts` — none may import a module's topic files.
   The facade is where a module decides what it exposes.
3. **Inside a module, only `*.routes.ts` may import `express`.** Everything
   else is HTTP-agnostic and testable with a fake `db`.
4. **Route files do not query the database.** Every `db.from(...)` /
   `db.rpc(...)` belongs to a service function with a name and a typed result.
5. **Facades re-export by name.** `export *` hides what a module exposes and
   invites accidental coupling.
6. **`middleware/` depends on `lib/`, not on modules.** Request plumbing must
   not pull a domain into every request.
7. **`src/routes/` does not exist.** A new HTTP surface is a new module.
8. **Document version writes belong to `modules/documents/`.** Creation, activation, replacement, and deletion go through its facade. The architecture test also rejects direct lifecycle RPC calls from other modules.

## Enforcement

`backend/src/__tests__/architecture.test.ts` walks every file under `src/`,
reads its imports, and fails on a violation of any rule above. It runs with the
normal unit suite (`npm test --prefix backend`), so a layering regression fails
CI the same way a broken assertion does. It needs no lint plugin: a directory
walk and an import regex are enough.

Each rule has an explicit allowlist in the test. Adding an entry is a reviewed
decision and needs a comment saying why; the ratchet for rule 4 records the
remaining inline queries per routes file and only ever goes down.

## The shared kernel (`lib/`)

`lib/` holds two kinds of code:

- **Infrastructure:** `db/` (the database handle), `gotrue`
  (the auth server's clients), `storage`, `queue/`, `dbq/` (durable jobs),
  `llm/`, `mcp/`, `httpError`, `serviceResult`, `pagination`, `search`,
  `privateIp`, `origins`, `runtimeConfig`, `courtlistener` (an external API
  client), `convert`, `pdfjs`, `zipExport`, `concurrency`.
- **Cross-domain primitives** that several modules and the job handlers share:
  `access` (project/document authorization), `audit` (audit-row writes),
  `documentTypes`, `documentVersions`, `modelSelection`, `routerModels`,
  `userLookup`, `workflowCatalog*` (used by the chat tools), `sourceDocuments`
  and pure shared utilities. Document-version reads can join across domains;
  mutations have one owner in the documents module.

The assistant engine lives in `modules/chat/engine/`. Other chat surfaces use
named exports from `chat.service.ts`. HTTP framing lives in `lib/assistantSse.ts`;
message reservation and persistence belong to the chat module.

## Background jobs

`jobs/registry.ts` composes domain handlers from module facades and supplies both
handlers and terminal-failure hooks to the queue runner. Importing a module does
not mutate a global handler map. `lib/dbq/` owns delivery, claiming, retries, and
retention; domain job bodies live with documents, tabular, user, audit, and memory.
BullMQ workers are transport adapters to those same domain operations.

Stale-work sweeps live in documents and tabular. `jobs/maintenance.ts` composes
them. Account erasure and export orchestration belong to the user module.

## Shared operations and caller-specific policy

Reuse an existing operation before adding another service implementation. The
following rules have a single implementation:

| Operation | Owner | Caller responsibilities |
|---|---|---|
| Rename a project's or library's active document version | `modules/documents/documents.rename.ts`, exported as `renameDocument` | Supply the actor and explicit project/library scope; adapt the result to the existing endpoint shape. The operation checks project permissions and scopes both document queries. |
| Delete collection documents and durably clean all version artifacts | `modules/documents/documents.cleanup.ts`, exported as `deleteCollectionDocuments` | Project callers authorize `docs.organize` and select document IDs inside that project first. Library callers supply the authenticated user's ID and collection; the operation filters eligible IDs. Deletion repeats the scope predicates; database triggers capture source, PDF, and extracted-text keys in the same transaction. |
| Resolve a chat turn's model and reasoning level | `modules/user/user.chatSelection.ts`, exported as `resolveUserChatSelection` | Authorize the chat first; retain each surface's persistence, error mapping, and stream lifetime. Selection itself does not mutate chats or saved preferences. |
| Validate folder paths and moves; collect a deletion subtree | `lib/folderTree.ts` | Supply a scoped folder list/loader and retain the endpoint's validation order and error messages. |
| Resolve an assignable organization member | `lib/orgAccessOverrides.ts`, `findAssignableOrgMember` | Authorize the actor's access-management permission and validate the requested role before resolving the target. Creators and organization admins retain owner access. |

Shared code must preserve meaningful differences. Library renames still expose
`folder_id` and project renames still conceal denied project access as 404.
Word's local chat mode remains free of chat persistence. Copy callers explicitly
choose their transport and whether a missing rendition is optional or fatal.

### Document lifecycle

- `createDocumentVersion` atomically allocates the version number, inserts the
  row, and activates it. Stable upload IDs are idempotent: a retry neither
  overwrites metadata nor reactivates an older version.
- `createDocumentVersions` commits a copy batch's versions and pointers together.
- `activateDocumentVersion` validates that the version is live and belongs to the
  document. Use deferred activation when dependent edit rows must be saved first.
- `updateDocumentVersion` repeats the document scope and excludes tombstones.
- `deleteVersion` retains its actor checks and uses a transaction that prevents
  deleting the final live version, including concurrent deletes.
- The `document_version_cleanup` trigger records source, PDF, and extracted-text
  cleanup in the deletion/replacement transaction. Cascades use the same rule.
  `document.cleanup` retries without a terminal attempt limit, protects surviving
  storage references, and waits for an in-flight text-cache writer.
- `DB_JOBS_ENABLED=false` uses the same cleanup implementation inline. The trigger
  still retains a durable job if storage fails; normal deployments require no
  application-level path enumeration before deletion.

The lifecycle primitives are trusted persistence operations, not permission
checks. Callers must authorize the destination and separately authorize a copy
source. Project, library, workflow, and upload-session policies remain explicit.

For changes to these rules, add a test of the shared operation and verify the
caller-specific permissions and response contracts. The rename route and
folder-service compatibility suites also pass against the pre-consolidation
PR snapshot (`54d067d3`), so their assertions characterize existing behavior.

## Shared API contracts

`packages/contracts` is the common declaration package for serialized assistant
activity, input requests/responses, source documents, and normalized Word edits.
All three applications resolve `@mike/contracts` to the same authored declarations.
Client event models add their rendering state locally. No client imports a backend
implementation to obtain these types. See [the package guide](../packages/contracts/README.md).

Existing module-local error unions remain supported. New operations use
`ServiceResult<T>`; a feature PR does not need to normalize unrelated endpoints.

## Adding a new domain

1. Create `src/modules/<domain>/` with `<name>.routes.ts` and
   `<name>.service.ts`; split into topic files when the service passes a few
   hundred lines. A service-only module (no HTTP surface) ships without a
   routes file — see "Module anatomy".
2. Mount the router in `app.ts`. A service-only module has nothing to mount.
3. Service functions take `db: Db` first and return `ServiceResult<T>` (or a
   module-local union); routes call `sendServiceFailure`.
4. Put unit tests in `src/modules/<domain>/__tests__/`; route-level behavior
   goes in `src/__tests__/integration/`.
5. Run `npm test --prefix backend -- src/__tests__/architecture.test.ts`. If it
   fails, the layering is wrong, not the test.

## Adding a feature within an existing domain

1. Find the operation's owner and call its facade. Add a topic file when the
   behavior is independently understandable; keep public exports named.
2. State the actor and resource scope in the operation's parameters. Check read
   and write permissions independently when a feature copies between scopes.
3. Change a shared wire declaration with its producer and client adapters.
4. Add the smallest useful regression test. Use the database lifecycle SQL tests
   for transaction/cascade behavior; mocks cannot establish transaction safety.
5. Run the architecture test, relevant unit/route tests, builds, and contract
   typecheck. A feature that adds a job also supplies its handler and failure
   hook through its domain facade to the composition root.

For example, a new “copy a library document into a workflow” feature should need
an authorized workflow operation, calls to `copyDocumentVersionFiles` and
`createDocumentVersion`, a route adapter, and tests of scope and response behavior.
It should not add another version counter, pointer update, or cleanup walker.
