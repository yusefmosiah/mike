# Manual and production deployment

Use this path when connecting Mike to your own Postgres, GoTrue auth server,
and S3-compatible storage instead of the infrastructure bundled with Docker
Compose. Mike needs only those three: Postgres for its data, GoTrue (the auth
server) for accounts and sessions, and a bucket for files.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 or newer
- npm and Git
- A Postgres 17 database Mike can reach directly
- A GoTrue auth server (v2.189.0 is the pinned, tested version) using the same
  database
- A Cloudflare R2, MinIO, or other S3-compatible bucket
- At least one supported model-provider API key, or an accessible Ollama server
- Optional: a CourtListener API token for case-law tools
- LibreOffice when DOC/DOCX-to-PDF conversion is required

## Database setup

GoTrue creates its own `auth` schema, including `auth.users`, the first time it
starts; Mike's schema references it. On a database of your own, first run
`docker/db-init/roles.sql` as a superuser: it creates GoTrue's
`gotrue` role and `auth` schema, plus the `anon`, `authenticated`
and `service_role` roles that `schema.sql` grants to (Mike never uses them;
they exist so its grants and row-level security apply unchanged). Point GoTrue
at the database as `gotrue` and start it once.

Then, for a fresh database, run `backend/schema.sql` once, with `psql`. The schema file contains the complete current database
shape.

For an existing deployment, do not run the complete schema over production
data. Back up the database first, identify the last migration already applied,
then apply each newer file in `backend/migrations/` in filename order.
Migration filenames follow `YYYYMMDD_NN_<name>.sql`.

Keep the last applied migration filename with your deployment records. Do not
blindly replay the directory against production: migrations are written for an
expected starting schema, and a successful fresh install from `schema.sql` is
not evidence that an older database has completed every upgrade step. The
repository's schema-drift CI separately checks that its pinned historical
baseline converges with the fresh schema after all later migrations run.

### After the organization-access upgrade: `tabular_review_legacy_shares`

`20260904_02_migrate_legacy_sharing.sql` converts the old roleless
`shared_with` arrays into real access grants. One shape has nowhere to go: a
tabular review that lives INSIDE a project now inherits access from that
project, so a share on the review alone cannot be reproduced without handing
the recipient the whole matter. That migration dropped
`tabular_reviews.shared_with` without recording those recipients.

`20260917_01_organization_access_followup.sql` creates
`public.tabular_review_legacy_shares` as the place those `(review, project,
email)` triples belong, and backfills it only if the `shared_with` column
still exists when it runs. On a deployment that already applied
`20260904_02` the column is gone, so the table lands EMPTY: the recipients
are recoverable only from a pre-upgrade backup. To recover them, restore the
old `shared_with` values into a scratch column named `shared_with` on
`tabular_reviews`, re-run `20260917_01` (it is safe to re-run), then drop the
scratch column. Fresh installs create the table empty and nothing writes it
at runtime. The table carries no foreign keys, so the record survives the
review or project being deleted. It is `service_role`-only; read it with the
service key:

```sql
select l.email, l.project_id, l.tabular_review_id, l.archived_at
from public.tabular_review_legacy_shares l
order by l.archived_at desc;
```

Each row is a person who could see that review before the upgrade and cannot
now. For each one, decide deliberately: grant them access to the project (or
add them to the organization) if they should still have it, and otherwise do
nothing. The table is a record, not a queue — nothing reads it, and rows may
be deleted once every recipient has been dealt with.

Apply the workflow catalog migration before deploying the matching backend
release, then run the dedicated ingestion job from the built backend artifact:

```bash
cd backend
npm run sync:workflows
```

The job resolves `MIKE_WORKFLOWS_REF`, downloads and validates the raw
`Open-Legal-Products/mike-workflows` archive, uploads reference assets to the
configured S3-compatible storage, and transactionally replaces the active
`mike_workflows` catalog. Temporary archive and JSON files are deleted when the
job exits. Run this as a release job before directing traffic to the new
backend; backend startup itself only reads the database. Docker Compose runs
this sequence automatically for local/self-hosted deployments.

## Environment

Copy the maintained examples:

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.local.example frontend/.env.local
```

Edit both files with the credentials and URLs for your deployment. At runtime,
the frontend server needs only `API_BASE_URL`; browsers call the same-origin
`/api` gateway and receive no auth URL, key, or session token. The variable
is not needed while building the frontend.

Use:

- `NODE_ENV=production` so startup enforces HTTPS and secure-cookie invariants
  (the backend Docker image sets this by default; see
  [Running the backend image](#running-the-backend-image));
- GoTrue's base URL, as the backend reaches it, for backend `AUTH_URL`;
- a `service_role` JWT signed with GoTrue's JWT secret for backend
  `AUTH_SERVICE_KEY`;
- GoTrue's browser-reachable base URL for backend `AUTH_PUBLIC_URL`, when it
  differs from `AUTH_URL` (OAuth sign-in sends the browser there);
- a direct Postgres connection string for backend `DATABASE_URL` (see below);
  and
- the internal Mike backend origin for frontend `API_BASE_URL`.

Mike queries Postgres over `DATABASE_URL` and nothing else; it does not use
PostgREST or any other data API. Chat runs on Pi Durable, which keeps every
conversation's model transcript, and any turn in flight, in its own schema of the same database (`pi_durable`, or
`PI_DURABLE_SCHEMA`). The backend creates the schema on first use. It needs a
direct, session-mode connection, not a transaction pooler, because it holds an
advisory lock on the schema for as long as it runs. Run one backend process per
database. A second one cannot take the lock, and its chat turns fail. A turn
interrupted by a restart or deploy resumes when the backend starts again (except
in a Word chat stored only on the device, which is stopped).

Set backend `API_PUBLIC_URL` to the browser-reachable frontend gateway, including
its `/api` prefix (for example, `https://app.example.com/api`). OAuth providers,
including MCP connectors, must return through that public gateway; never use an
internal container hostname such as `http://backend:3001` for callbacks.

Never expose auth session tokens, the service-role key, model-provider
keys, or storage secrets in frontend JavaScript.

Production web auth cookies are `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, path `/`,
and use the `__Host-` prefix. Word task-pane cookies additionally use
`SameSite=None` and `Partitioned` so an HTTPS pane embedded in Word on the web
can authenticate without exposing tokens to JavaScript. The add-in serves and
proxies `/api` from one origin; the backend still validates the original
`Origin` header. Terminate TLS at both public origins, and set `FRONTEND_URL`
plus `WORD_ADDIN_URL` to their exact values.

When `WORD_ADDIN_URL` is configured, also set a dedicated, high-entropy
`AUTH_HANDOFF_ENCRYPTION_SECRET`. Google OAuth transfers from its Office dialog
to the task pane using a request-bound, encrypted, single-use database ticket
that expires after two minutes. Apply
`20260825_01_auth_handoff_tickets.sql` before enabling this flow.

The first deployment intentionally signs out sessions created by older builds:
the web app deletes legacy auth local/session-storage entries and the Word
add-in deletes legacy OfficeRuntime access/refresh tokens. Users authenticate
once to establish the new cookie; tokens are not copied through JavaScript.

### Object-storage CORS for direct uploads

Mike's upload-session API gives an authenticated browser a short-lived signed
`PUT` URL for one specific staging object. The bucket must therefore allow
browser `PUT` requests from each deployed frontend origin. Configure the
equivalent of this CORS policy in Cloudflare R2, MinIO, RustFS, or the selected
S3-compatible provider:

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": ["https://your-mike.example"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["PUT", "HEAD"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["Content-Type", "x-amz-*"],
    "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600
  }
]
```

List exact trusted origins; do not use `*` for a production deployment. The
signed URL authorizes only its generated object key and expires independently
of the CORS cache. The backend still verifies the uploaded byte count and
copies accepted bytes to a non-signed, sealed key before queuing processing.
Each file is verified and queued as soon as its individual `PUT` completes;
the remaining files in the same session may continue uploading while the
worker creates documents or document versions from earlier files. Success and
definite transfer failure are both reported through the file's idempotent
completion endpoint. The client retries that control request and then polls the
session, whose status is derived from its file rows; there is no separate
session-wide completion request.

Upload sessions accept at most 50 supported files, 100 MB per file, and 2 GB
in total. Users may run multiple independent upload sessions concurrently and,
by default, may create at most 50 sessions per hour. Upload-session mutation,
polling, and hourly creation limits can be overridden with the
`RATE_LIMIT_UPLOAD_SESSION_*` environment variables documented in
`backend/.env.example`; missing or invalid values use the documented defaults.
Sessions that update the same mutable document version remain mutually
exclusive. Sessions
expire after 30 minutes, extended by a further 30 minutes each time a file
completes so a slow batch is not destroyed mid-upload, up to four hours from
creation; individual signed URLs expire after 15 minutes and can
be refreshed while the session is pending. These limits are enforced atomically
in PostgreSQL, not only in the browser.

The Express process also runs a durable upload-processing pool. By default,
each backend replica claims up to 8 jobs concurrently while PostgreSQL limits
each user to two active jobs across all replicas. Override these defaults with
`UPLOAD_PROCESSING_CONCURRENCY` (capped at 64) and
`UPLOAD_PROCESSING_MAX_RUNNING_PER_USER`; every claim loop polls the database,
so raising the pool raises idle query load in proportion. Workers claim jobs
with database leases, retry a failed file up to three times, and clean expired,
cancelled, and terminally failed temporary objects. A single document
conversion is killed after `UPLOAD_CONVERT_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 120000, clamped
to 10000-600000) and a worker stops renewing its lease after
`UPLOAD_JOB_WALL_CLOCK_MS` (default 900000, clamped to 60000-3600000) so a
wedged job is recovered by another worker instead of holding its slot. Terminal session metadata is retained
for seven days so clients can inspect outcomes, then deleted in bounded cleanup
batches.
Deployments must therefore run `backend/src/index.ts`
(the normal `npm start` entry point), rather than importing the Express app
without starting its worker.

Model-provider keys and the CourtListener token can be configured globally in
`backend/.env` or per user under **Settings > API Keys**. A personal key takes
precedence over the matching globally configured key; removing the personal
key restores the global key as the fallback.

### Error tracking

Error reports are sent to the Mike project's own Sentry by default, so the
maintainers can fix failures encountered by forks and self-hosted installs.
Before network transmission, every runtime rebuilds reports from an explicit
allowlist: code locations and line numbers, controlled operation labels,
HTTP method/status and normalized routes, validated correlation IDs, release,
and environment. Client document filenames, document text, raw error and
console messages, request URLs/queries/headers/bodies, user identities, and
breadcrumbs are excluded. Automatic sessions, replay, attachments, traces,
and other non-error payloads are blocked. The same boundary applies to
community and official installations. See the [observability guide](observability.md)
for the exact policy, source-map behavior, and limitations.
To opt out, set `SENTRY_DISABLED=true`
(`NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DISABLED=true` / `REACT_APP_SENTRY_DISABLED=true` for the
browser and add-in builds); to use your own Sentry instead, set the matching
`*_SENTRY_DSN`.

For the compose stack that is `SENTRY_DISABLED=true` in the root `.env`
(the backend reads it through `env_file`; the frontend build and the Next
server receive it from compose). To report to your own Sentry instead, set
`SENTRY_DSN` (backend) and `FRONTEND_SENTRY_DSN` (web app). What is reported,
what is scrubbed, and how to verify are in [observability.md](observability.md).

## Authentication email

GoTrue sends signup, email-change, and password-recovery messages. Configure
production SMTP through its `GOTRUE_SMTP_*` variables; Mike does not require a Resend API key for these
messages.

Set GoTrue's Site URL (`GOTRUE_SITE_URL`) to the deployed frontend origin and
add that origin's `/auth/callback` URL to its redirect allow list
(`GOTRUE_URI_ALLOW_LIST`). For example:

```text
https://your-mike.example/auth/callback
```

Enable email confirmation for production signups. Keep secure email change
enabled so GoTrue requires confirmation from both the current and proposed
addresses. Set the minimum password length to 10; this applies when passwords
are created or changed and does not invalidate existing shorter passwords. The
same callback handles signup confirmation, confirmed email
changes, and password-recovery links before sending the user to the appropriate
Mike page.

Review GoTrue's email templates after changing the public Site URL, and
test every link against the deployed frontend before inviting users. Existing
deployments must also apply the latest migration so confirmed email changes are
mirrored into `user_profiles`.

## Google authentication

Create a **Web application** OAuth client in Google Auth Platform. Its
authorized redirect URI is GoTrue's callback, not Mike's frontend callback:
`AUTH_PUBLIC_URL` + `/callback`, for example

```text
https://auth.example.com/callback
```

Enable Google in GoTrue (`GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_*`) with the client ID and secret, and allow both
deployed Mike clients as redirect targets:

```text
https://your-mike.example/auth/callback
https://your-word-addin.example/oauth-dialog.html
```

The Word add-in completes authentication in an Office Dialog. The dialog gives
the task pane only an opaque, short-lived, single-use handoff ticket. The task
pane redeems it through the same-origin add-in proxy, and the backend writes its
HttpOnly cookie. No access or refresh token enters add-in JavaScript or
OfficeRuntime storage. The add-in also does not retain Google's provider access
token or request Google Drive or Gmail access.

## Enterprise SSO (SAML)

Self-hosted Mike can use SAML providers registered in GoTrue,
including Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, and Google Workspace SAML. The login page
offers an SSO entry point; the backend permits the flow only when SSO is
enabled. The existing email/password and Google methods remain available; this
feature does not enforce SSO-only access.

### Configure GoTrue

For the Compose GoTrue service, uncomment the SAML environment entries in
`docker-compose.yml`. Set `GOTRUE_SAML_ENABLED=true`, provide
`GOTRUE_SAML_PRIVATE_KEY`, and set `GOTRUE_SAML_EXTERNAL_URL` to GoTrue's public
base URL (the Compose file uses `AUTH_PUBLIC_URL`), for example
`https://auth.example.com`. GoTrue appends `/sso/saml/acs` and
`/sso/saml/metadata` to this base. Configure these values in the root Compose `.env` or shell environment;
`backend/.env` is loaded by the backend service, not the Auth service.

The pinned GoTrue version expects a standard base64-encoded **PKCS#1 DER RSA
private key** (at least 2048 bits), not PEM or PKCS#8. With OpenSSL 3:

```bash
umask 077
openssl genrsa -traditional -out saml-private.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in saml-private.pem -traditional -outform DER -out saml-private.der
openssl base64 -A -in saml-private.der -out saml-private.base64
```

Put the base64 file's contents in `GOTRUE_SAML_PRIVATE_KEY` using your deployment
secret store. Keep the key stable across restarts and replicas; rotating it
requires updating the IdP's trust configuration. Keep all key files outside the
repository. Restart the Auth service after configuring SAML.

In GoTrue, set `GOTRUE_SITE_URL` to the deployed frontend origin and restrict
`GOTRUE_URI_ALLOW_LIST` to the frontend's `/auth/callback` URL (plus existing
required callbacks). Replace the permissive local Compose allowlist for a
public deployment.

### Register an identity provider

Import the service provider metadata from:

```text
https://auth.example.com/sso/saml/metadata
```

Use its entity ID/audience and assertion consumer service (ACS) URL in your
IdP. The ACS is `https://auth.example.com/sso/saml/acs`, not Mike's
frontend callback. Configure the IdP to supply an email attribute and assign
the intended users or groups to the application.

For example, create a SAML 2.0 application in Okta, set its Single sign-on URL
to the ACS and Audience URI to the metadata entity ID, and add an `email`
attribute containing the user's email. Obtain the IdP metadata URL. Entra ID
enterprise applications and Google Workspace custom SAML applications use the
same service provider metadata; export their IdP metadata XML if they do not
provide a publicly fetchable HTTPS metadata URL.

Register the provider through GoTrue's admin API from a trusted administrative
machine. Replace these placeholders; the bearer token must be an administrative
`service_role` JWT, never a browser credential:

```bash
curl --fail-with-body --request POST \
  'https://auth.example.com/admin/sso/providers' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <SERVICE_ROLE_JWT>' \
  --header 'apikey: <SERVICE_ROLE_JWT>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "type": "saml",
    "metadata_url": "https://idp.example.com/app/metadata",
    "domains": ["example.com"],
    "attribute_mapping": {"keys": {"email": {"name": "email"}}}
  }'
```

Use `metadata_xml` instead of `metadata_url` when importing XML. Match the
attribute mapping to the IdP's actual attribute name. The `domains` field maps
an exact domain to this provider; add all domains your users will enter. List
providers with `GET /admin/sso/providers`; use
`PUT /admin/sso/providers/<provider-id>` to update an existing provider
instead of repeating creation. Keep admin access restricted.

### Enable Mike and verify sign-in

Set these in `backend/.env` (or the backend service environment), then restart
the backend. No frontend rebuild is needed:

```dotenv
SSO_ENABLED=true
SSO_ALLOWED_DOMAINS=example.com
```

`SSO_ENABLED` defaults to false and enables only with `true` (case-insensitive).
The SSO screen asks for a company email and uses its normalized domain to find
the matching provider; the email itself is not sent to GoTrue during provider
discovery. `SSO_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` is an optional comma-separated list of exact
domains. Use DNS names, or punycode for international domains, without URLs or
wildcards. Invalid domain settings fail closed. Omitting the allowlist permits
any domain registered in GoTrue.
The allowlist controls Mike's sign-in initiation, not account authorization or
direct access to GoTrue; enforce membership and access policy at the IdP and
Auth service.

Mike calls GoTrue's `/sso` API using GoTrue's server-side client, which sends
`skip_http_redirect: true` and a PKCE challenge. After IdP authentication,
GoTrue redirects to Mike's existing `/auth/callback`; the backend exchanges
the code using its HttpOnly verifier cookie and establishes the normal session.
Start sign-in from Mike in the same browser; IdP-initiated flows are outside
this integration. The Word add-in's existing authentication remains unchanged.

Before inviting users, verify the metadata contains the public ACS URL, try
both an assigned and an unassigned IdP user, confirm return to onboarding or
the app, and confirm logout and an unapproved domain behave as expected. SAML
identities can be separate accounts from existing email/Google identities; do
not assume matching emails link accounts or transfer project access.

Cloudflare Access or IAP in front of Mike is complementary perimeter access
control. It does not establish Mike's session and is not a substitute
for this SAML integration. Ensure the IdP/browser can reach the required SAML
endpoints through any perimeter controls.

## Install and run

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install --prefix backend
npm install --prefix frontend
npm install --prefix word-addin
```

For development, start the packages in separate terminals:

```bash
npm run dev --prefix backend
```

```bash
npm run dev --prefix frontend
```

For production, build both packages and run their `start` scripts through your
process manager or deployment platform:

```bash
npm run build --prefix backend
npm run build --prefix frontend
```

If port 3001 (or `PORT`) is already taken, for example by the Docker Compose
backend, the backend reports the bind failure and exits instead of starting
without a listener.

### Running the backend image

The backend image sets `NODE_ENV=production`, so it refuses to start unless
`FRONTEND_URL` and `API_PUBLIC_URL` are set to `https` URLs (and
`WORD_ADDIN_URL`, when set, is too). That default is deliberate: an image
deployed without `NODE_ENV` must not quietly issue non-`Secure` cookies.
Docker Compose overrides it with `NODE_ENV=development` and local `http` URLs,
which is why `docker compose up` works without TLS.

The image contains no `.env` file. Pass the backend environment explicitly:

```bash
docker build -t mike-backend -f backend/Dockerfile .
docker run --rm -p 3001:3001 --env-file backend/.env \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  -e FRONTEND_URL=https://app.example.com \
  -e API_PUBLIC_URL=https://app.example.com/api \
  mike-backend
```

To try the image on your own machine over plain `http`, pass
`-e NODE_ENV=development` with `http://localhost` URLs instead. When required
settings are missing, the fatal startup message lists each variable and
repeats this choice.

The repository includes Dockerfiles for the backend, frontend, and Word add-in.
Build and run the production add-in host with its public URLs baked into the
static bundle and its private backend origin supplied only at runtime:

```bash
docker build -t mike-word-addin \
  --build-arg REACT_APP_WEB_APP_URL=https://app.example.com \
  --build-arg WORD_ADDIN_PUBLIC_URL=https://word.example.com \
  -f word-addin/Dockerfile .
docker run --rm -p 3200:3200 \
  -e WORD_ADDIN_BACKEND_ORIGIN=http://backend:3001 \
  mike-word-addin
```

Put an HTTPS ingress or reverse proxy in front of port 3200. The included host
serves `dist/` and streams `/api/*` to the backend while preserving cookies,
`Set-Cookie`, `Origin`, request bodies, and SSE responses.

## Background jobs and Redis

Mike runs durable background jobs (document conversion, tabular extraction,
audit recording, account deletion, storage cleanup, export builds) through one
of two interchangeable transports:

- **With Redis** (`REDIS_URL` set): jobs are delivered instantly through
  BullMQ, and tabular reviews stream live progress over Redis pub/sub. The
  bundled Docker Compose stack ships a Redis service and enables this by
  default for new installs.
- **Without Redis**: the same jobs run through a Postgres-backed queue
  (`db_jobs`, created by the schema/migrations) with a polling worker. No
  extra infrastructure is required — an existing deployment that upgrades in
  place keeps working with no configuration changes and no Redis. Progress
  streaming falls back to short database polls.

The transport is selected automatically; `QUEUE_DRIVER=postgres` forces the
database queue even when `REDIS_URL` is set.

By default, workers run in a worker thread inside the backend process, so no
extra process management is needed. (Under tsx — `npm run dev` and the local
test harnesses — they run inline on the main thread instead: tsx cannot load
the ESM model runtime inside a worker thread.) To run them on separate hardware, start
`node dist/worker.js` (any number of instances — work is partitioned safely)
and set `WORKERS_MODE=none` on the API process. The compose file contains a
commented `worker` service demonstrating this.

### Document lifecycle migration

Apply `20260914_01_document_lifecycle.sql` before deploying the backend that uses
its version RPCs. Fresh installs include it in `backend/schema.sql`; Compose's
`db-init` service applies it during upgrades. Do not remove pending
`document.cleanup` jobs: they retain the object keys needed to finish erasure.
The migration makes both queue claim paths recover failed cleanup jobs, including
ones rejected by an older worker during rollout, and exhausted stale claims.
Keep failed cleanup rows as well as pending ones; upgraded workers reclaim them.

Backend and frontend Docker build contexts are now the repository root, so both
can compile against `packages/contracts`. For a manual backend image build use
`docker build -f backend/Dockerfile -t mike-backend .` from the root.

Each image reads only what its Dockerfile copies: the frontend image contains
`frontend/` and `packages/contracts`; the add-in image adds `frontend/src/shared`
and `frontend/public/icons`, which its bundle includes. In the frontend image
`next build` type-checks `frontend/tsconfig.build.json`, which excludes test
files, so test fixtures and sibling applications never become build inputs. CI builds all three
images on every pull request (`.github/workflows/docker-images.yml`), so a
source change that reaches outside a build context fails before merge instead
of on the next fresh install.

## Deployment safety

- Generate unique, high-entropy signing and encryption secrets.
- Use your own GoTrue JWT secret and service-role key, and a real database
  password, rather than the local demo values.
- Keep backend secrets out of `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables.
- Configure spending limits for model-provider keys where supported.
- Confirm LibreOffice is available to the backend and worker if document
  conversion is enabled. The backend Docker image and `backend/nixpacks.toml`
  install it; elsewhere the backend looks on `PATH`, in the usual Linux
  locations, and in `/Applications/LibreOffice.app` on macOS. Set
  `SOFFICE_BINARY_PATH` to the `soffice` executable for any other location.
  Without it, Word and presentation uploads are kept without a PDF rendition
  and the worker logs `conversion_unavailable` once per upload.
- Confirm the backend can reach the object store with the configured `R2_*`
  credentials before accepting uploads. When it cannot, completing an upload
  answers 503 and the server log names the failing storage operation and the
  store's own error (for example `ECONNREFUSED`, `InvalidAccessKeyId`, or
  `NoSuchBucket`); clean-up deletes of temporary upload objects are reported
  once per upload as warnings.
- Review storage, logging, retention, and deletion behavior before processing
  confidential documents.

## This repository's staging (node-a)

https://choir-ip.com runs the Compose stack on node-a under rootful Podman,
configured by `infra/node-a/staging.nix`. Every push to `main` deploys there
once CI passes (`.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml`):

1. The workflow connects as `mike-deploy`, a user whose key may only run
   `deploy <full commit sha>` (no shell, no forwarding).
2. node-a fetches `main` from GitHub and refuses a commit that is not on
   `main`, or that is older than the commit it already serves.
3. It builds that exact tree (`.git-sha` names it), starts it, and waits up
   to five minutes for `/`, `/api/health` and `/gotrue/health`. If they fail,
   it restores the previous tree and the workflow fails.

Deploy a commit by hand with `ssh root@51.81.93.94 mike-staging deploy-sha
<sha>`, or rerun the workflow with "Run workflow". The deploy key's private
half is the `STAGING_DEPLOY_KEY` Actions secret; replace it by generating a
new pair, putting the public key in `deployKey` in `staging.nix`, and setting
the secret. New migrations reach staging through the `db-init` service, so
add them to `docker-compose.yml` as for any Compose install.

Signup is open without email confirmation (`GOTRUE_DISABLE_SIGNUP=false`,
`GOTRUE_MAILER_AUTOCONFIRM=true` in `/var/lib/mike-staging/secrets.env`):
staging has no outgoing mail (Mailpit catches it). Change either key there and
run `mike-staging compose up -d auth` to apply it.
