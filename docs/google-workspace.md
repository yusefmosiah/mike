# Gmail and Google Calendar

Drive, Gmail, and Calendar are delivered together in [PR #434](https://github.com/open-legal-products/mike/pull/434). The Gmail/Calendar design is recorded in [#521](https://github.com/open-legal-products/mike/issues/521).

## User behavior

**Connecting is always opt-in, including for users who sign into Mike with Google.** Mike sign-in tokens are never reused for Gmail or Calendar. Gmail and Calendar behave like every other connector in Settings → Connectors. In **Discover**, choose **Add**: the button shows **Adding...** while Mike starts authorization and **Cancel** while Google's window is open. There is no Mike account-selection dialog. After authorization, the Discover card shows **Added** and the connector appears under **Installed** with an on/off switch. Click it to open the same Manage dialog Slack uses: account, **Read-only** (disable write tools while preserving individual choices), **Ask for permission for write actions**, a switch per tool, **Refresh**, and **Delete**. If the server has no Google OAuth app configured, **Add** shows the same **Could not add connector** warning as Slack, with the server's setup steps and a guide link. Google shows an account chooser: choose a personal Gmail or Workspace account, including one different from your Mike login and different accounts for Gmail and Calendar. Each Mike user has one connection per service; choosing another account replaces that service's connection but keeps its settings.

Workspace administrators and Google Cloud audience settings can restrict which accounts may authorize the app. Configure an External audience to support accounts outside the Cloud project's organization. Testing mode also requires those accounts in the test-user list. Account selection cannot override Google's policy.

Mike asks Google for read and write access on every connect. Google's consent screen lets the user untick permissions, and Workspace administrators can block them; if write access is withheld, the connection works read-only and the write tools are hidden from the assistant. To gain write access, delete the connector in the Manage dialog and connect it again.

By default the assistant runs write actions directly, as it does for every connector. Turn on **Ask for permission for write actions** in the connector's Manage dialog to review each one first. The assistant's turn then pauses with an approval in the same popup it uses for questions: it shows the exact account, recipients, content, and affected item. **Approve** runs that action and the turn continues with its result; **Reject** tells the assistant it did not run. The approval is part of the conversation, so it survives a reload. Individual tools can also be switched off in the Manage dialog.

| Service | Reads | Changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gmail | Search messages, read messages/threads, list labels, list/read drafts | Send new plain-text email; create/replace/delete drafts; add/remove message labels; move messages to Trash |
| Calendar | List calendars, search/list events, read individual events | Create, patch, or delete a single event or recurring occurrence; Google notifies attendees |

Gmail Trash is recoverable through Gmail; permanently deleting received/sent mail is not exposed. Draft deletion removes the draft. Sent email body editing is not supported; message edits concern labels. Draft replacement is plain text and rejects drafts with attachments or reply headers, so it cannot silently discard attachments or detach a reply from its conversation. Sending attachments, sending existing drafts, email-thread replies, calendar administration, and entire recurring-series mutations are outside this version. Attendee changes replace the attendee list; the approval shows the new list and the existing event.

## Operator setup

1. Apply `backend/migrations/20260922_01_google_workspace.sql`, `backend/migrations/20261001_01_connector_write_access.sql`, and `backend/migrations/20261002_03_connector_read_only.sql` to the intended deployment after the Drive migration. Fresh installs include their final schema in `backend/schema.sql`; Compose's db-init applies any that the database's `schema_migrations` ledger does not list. No remote database changes are performed by the tests below.
2. Enable **Gmail API** (`gmail.googleapis.com`) and **Google Calendar API** (`calendar-json.googleapis.com`) in the OAuth client's Google Cloud project. These are the REST APIs, not the Google MCP preview services.
3. Configure a Web application OAuth client. The existing Drive client may be reused. Register these exact local redirect URIs:

   ```text
   http://localhost:3000/api/user/integrations/gmail/oauth/callback
   http://localhost:3000/api/user/integrations/google-calendar/oauth/callback
   ```

   Production uses the corresponding `<API_PUBLIC_URL>/user/integrations/.../oauth/callback`. The Next.js gateway on 3000 forwards to Express on 3001. SSO retains its separate GoTrue callback; adding these callbacks does not change sign-in behavior.
4. Set `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` in backend environment. If both are absent, the complete Drive/MCP credential profile is reused. An incomplete dedicated pair fails closed. Preserve the encryption secret used by the parent integration; never rotate it as a setup workaround.
5. Add these consent scopes. Mike requests all of them on connect; the write permission is the one users or administrators may withhold:

   | Connection | Read permission | Write permission |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | Gmail | `openid`, `email`, `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly` | `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify` |
   | Calendar | `openid`, `email`, `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.calendarlist.readonly`, `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events.readonly` | `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events` |

   OpenID/email identifies the selected account for the Manage dialog and approvals. No Mike login email is passed as a hint or used to restrict account choice. Each deployment's OAuth audience and use determine Google's verification requirements; see the self-hosting guidance below, [Gmail scopes](https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/auth/scopes), and [Calendar scopes](https://developers.google.com/workspace/calendar/api/auth).
6. Restart the backend after environment changes. In Testing mode, add each intended Google account as a test user. Verify that the saved client ID matches the one used by Mike; enabling an API does not fix an OAuth redirect mismatch.

## Shipping to self-hosted deployments

This feature ships as software that each operator configures and hosts. **Every deployment supplies its own Google Cloud project and OAuth client.** Mike does not distribute a shared client secret, and releasing this PR does not require publishing one central Mike OAuth app for all installations. A successful test of our development client does not authorize a customer's client.

Choose the audience for the accounts that will connect to that installation:

| Deployment | Google configuration | Remaining operator work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| One Workspace organization, only its members | An organization-owned project with an **Internal** OAuth audience | A Workspace administrator may need to allow the client and requested services/scopes. Internal apps qualify for Google's internal-use verification exception; external Gmail accounts cannot connect. |
| Development or evaluation with personal Gmail or external accounts | **External / Testing**, with every account explicitly listed as a test user | Suitable for acceptance tests, not unattended long-term use: these scopes receive refresh tokens that expire after seven days, and test-user limits apply. |
| An installation serving accounts outside its organization | **External**, with publication/verification appropriate to that deployment | Complete branding, authorized domains, public policy information, and Google's sensitive/restricted-scope verification or establish an applicable exception. Restricted-scope server-side use can require a security assessment. Self-hosting alone is not a verification exception. |

Google also documents personal-use and development/testing exceptions. Operators must use the exception that actually describes their deployment; changing the audience to Internal to remove a warning would exclude users outside that organization. Workspace administrators can block an app even when it is verified. See [Google's audience settings](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/15549945), [verification exceptions](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/13464323), [restricted-scope verification](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/production-readiness/restricted-scope-verification), and [refresh-token expiration](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2#expiration).

For each production installation:

1. Apply the Drive and Workspace migrations through the normal deployment procedure; configure a stable encryption secret and keep all OAuth secrets on the backend.
2. Enable Drive, Gmail, and Calendar REST APIs in that installation's project and configure the read and write scopes above. An organization that must not grant write access can block the write scopes in its Workspace admin console; connections then work read-only.
3. Set `FRONTEND_URL` and `API_PUBLIC_URL` to the installation's public HTTPS origins. Register all three exact callback URLs derived from `API_PUBLIC_URL`, ending in `/user/integrations/{google-drive,gmail,google-calendar}/oauth/callback`. For a same-origin gateway, `API_PUBLIC_URL=https://mike.example.com/api`; for a separate public API, it may be `https://api.example.com`. Preserve the separate GoTrue sign-in callback if Google sign-in is enabled.
4. Complete the audience-specific Google and Workspace-admin steps above, restart Mike, and run the acceptance checklist with synthetic data using that installation's own client.
5. Verify connection with and without write access, direct writes, approval/rejection with **Ask for permission for write actions** on, token refresh after restart, account replacement, and Delete. Keep the resulting proof with the deployment record.

Locally, the recommended callback origin is `http://localhost:3000/api`: Next's gateway forwards the server request to Express on `3001`. The fact that the frontend also uses port 3000 does not make the OAuth code exchange browser-side. Registering port 3001 instead works only when Mike is configured to emit that exact direct-API callback; changing Google's setting alone creates a mismatch.

## Technical approach and boundaries

- `googleWorkspaceAuth.ts`: explicit provider-scoped, per-user PKCE OAuth state, offline access, encrypted credentials, identity from Google's authenticated userinfo endpoint, and refresh compare-and-set. OAuth callbacks relay to a fixed `FRONTEND_URL` gateway, where completion requires the authenticated Mike user who initiated that state (including MFA when enrolled). This also works when `API_PUBLIC_URL` is a separate API origin. OAuth states expire after ten minutes and are consumed atomically with token replacement. Disconnect removes pending states before a late callback can save credentials. Refresh cannot resurrect a disconnected/replaced grant.
- `googleWorkspaceApi.ts`: allowlisted tools and strict argument schemas over Google's REST APIs. Message body conversion returns plain text; attachment content is omitted. Google responses have an 8 MiB / 30-second bound; message previews cap at 60,000 characters, thread reads at 20 messages/3,000 characters each, result pages at 25, and overall serialized tool results at 120,000 characters. Larger results require narrower searches. Truncation is explicit. Retrieved text is untrusted model context and may become part of the selected model's input and stored chat history, just like Drive.
- `googleWorkspace.ts`: builds the assistant's tools from the grant: nothing while the connection is off, no switched-off tools, and no write tools unless Google granted write access. Each call re-checks those settings. A write runs directly unless the connection asks for permission; then `planGoogleWorkspaceCall` prepares the action (reading the item it changes, and the Calendar ETag) and returns an approval item bound to the current `grant_id`.
- Approvals use the assistant's `ask_inputs` pause (`modules/chat/engine/tools/connectorApprovals.ts`), shared with MCP connectors. The approval item is stored on the paused assistant message. The client sends only `approve` or `reject`; the one-step `append_chat_ask_inputs_response` RPC that makes answers single-use records it, and only then does the server run the stored action. It refuses to run if the grant was replaced, write access was withdrawn, or the tool or connection was switched off. The result is appended to the same message and the turn continues. Surfaces without that continuation (the Word add-in, tabular review) refuse writes that need approval instead.
- `useGoogleConnector.ts` and the connectors page: Google connectors use the same Discover card, Installed card, `ConnectorDetailsModal`, and **Could not add connector** warning as MCP connectors. OAuth cancellation covers the Google window, and MFA retries reopen it. A reconnect waits for a new grant rather than treating the existing connection as success.
- RLS is enabled and browser roles have no direct grant/state table or lifecycle-RPC access. Mutation routes, including connector settings, require authentication, trusted-origin checks through existing auth middleware, and MFA when enrolled. Account deletion cascades both tables.
- Calendar patch/delete uses the ETag read when the action was prepared via `If-Match`, rejecting changes made in between. Entire recurring series are rejected. Gmail does not offer equivalent conditional draft writes: Mike checks draft message ID/history before execution, but a concurrent Gmail edit after that check can still race. Avoid editing a draft in Gmail while approving its replacement in Mike.
- Writes are **at most once**, not exactly-once delivery. If a request fails after it reached Google, the outcome is reported as uncertain and never retried automatically; if the server stops after an approval is recorded but before its result is saved, the assistant is told the outcome is unknown. Inspect Google before asking again. Delete cannot retract a request already in flight.
- Deleting Gmail or Calendar removes that local connection without Google-wide revocation, because revoking a shared OAuth client can invalidate the other services too. Remove all access in Google's account settings when desired. Drive uses the same local-only behavior. Google project-wide revocation would invalidate all services and OAuth clients sharing that grant.
- Approved actions and their results are stored in the conversation like other tool activity. Tokens are never returned to the model or logged.

## Manual acceptance checklist

Use two test Google accounts and synthetic mail/events; do not use real client information. Record the commit, browser, accounts (redact as appropriate), and result for each step.

1. Sign into Mike with Google SSO. Both cards must appear in Discover with an Add button, and the assistant must have no Gmail/Calendar tools. Repeat with password login. Merely visiting settings must not open consent.
2. Connect Gmail using a different Google account from the Mike login, unticking the write permission on Google's consent screen. Verify it connects read-only and no write tools are listed. Verify the chooser and connected email. Connect Calendar using another account. Reload and restart: the correct service-specific identity persists.
3. Search for a synthetic email marker and read the message and thread. Verify text, headers, labels, attachment metadata, pagination, and truncation. List calendars and events in a known time range, including an all-day event and a recurring occurrence.
4. Ask to send/edit/delete while connected read-only. No mutation occurs. Delete the connector, connect it again, and grant write access; the write tools then appear.
5. With **Ask for permission for write actions** off, ask for a new email to a test recipient: exactly one email is sent. Turn the setting on and ask again: the turn pauses on an approval showing every recipient, subject, body, and the connected account, and nothing is sent. Approve it: exactly one email is sent and the assistant continues with the result. Reload and double-click must not send it again. Reject a second request and verify no send.
6. Create a draft, replace its content, and delete it. Modify a test message's labels and move another to Trash. Try header-injection text, attachment-bearing draft replacement, and reply-draft replacement; all must be rejected safely.
7. Create a calendar event with a test attendee, then edit and delete it. Verify invitation/update/cancellation notices. With approvals on, change an event directly in Calendar after the approval appears: approving must reject the stale version. Entire recurring-series edits must be rejected; a single occurrence is supported.
8. Switch off a tool, then the whole connection: the assistant must lose those tools. With an approval pending, change Google accounts or delete the connection: approving must not run against either account. A second Mike user must not be able to answer the first user's approval.
9. Cancel immediately after clicking Add, close the popup, and test with popup blocking. Confirm retry works without a dangling authorization. For MFA-enrolled users, test connection, reconnect, settings changes, and Delete through the verification prompt.
10. Revoke the Google grant externally, then exercise token refresh: show reconnect guidance without exposing provider errors. Simulate a dropped mutation response: show an uncertain outcome and do not retry automatically.

Live Google consent and external mutation checks are required in addition to mocked tests. They cannot pass until the real Cloud client's APIs, callbacks, audience, and scope settings are correct.

## Automated checks

```bash
npm test --prefix backend -- src/lib/integrations/__tests__/googleWorkspace.test.ts src/__tests__/integration/googleWorkspace.routes.test.ts
bash backend/scripts/test-google-workspace-db.sh
npm test --prefix backend -- src/modules/chat/engine/__tests__/connectorApprovals.test.ts src/modules/chat/engine/__tests__/googleWorkspaceDispatch.test.ts
npm test --prefix frontend -- "src/app/(pages)/settings/connectors/page.test.tsx" src/app/components/assistant/AskInputPopup.test.tsx src/app/lib/mikeApi.test.ts
npx playwright test e2e/google-workspace.spec.ts e2e/connector-approval.spec.ts
npm run build --prefix backend
npm run typecheck:test --prefix backend
npm run typecheck --prefix frontend
npm run lint --prefix frontend
```

The database script uses a new throwaway PostgreSQL container, no host ports, and removes it on exit. It verifies actual grants/RLS configuration, cross-provider and replayed authorization, write access following the granted scopes, settings surviving a reconnect, and migration replay. It never connects to your configured database.

PR #434 contains the complete integration and targets `main`. It includes both migrations and all three service connections; there is no separate child PR to merge. CI verifies application builds/tests, production images, schema drift, security, the database and auth stack, browser behavior, and the Word add-in.
