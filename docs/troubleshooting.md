# Troubleshooting

## A local account says “Email not confirmed”

Docker autoconfirms newly created accounts by default. Accounts created before
autoconfirm was enabled remain unconfirmed. Confirm the existing message in
[Mailpit](http://localhost:8025), or create a new local account.

To test confirmation deliberately, set `GOTRUE_MAILER_AUTOCONFIRM=false` in the
root `.env` and recreate the Auth service:

```bash
docker compose up -d --force-recreate auth
```

## Production authentication email does not arrive

Authentication email is sent by GoTrue. Check its SMTP settings (the
`GOTRUE_SMTP_*` variables, or the dashboard of a hosted auth provider),
delivery logs, and rate limits. Mike intentionally shows the same password-reset response
for registered and unregistered addresses, so that screen cannot confirm
whether an account exists.

## A confirmation or password-reset link is rejected

Confirm that the deployed frontend's exact `/auth/callback` URL is present in
GoTrue's redirect allow list (`GOTRUE_URI_ALLOW_LIST`) and that the Site URL uses the correct
scheme and hostname. Request a new message after correcting either value;
authentication links expire and may only be usable once.

For a secure email change, GoTrue sends messages to both the current and new
addresses. The change remains pending until both messages are confirmed. If an
email change succeeds in Auth but the profile still shows the old address,
verify that the latest database migration has been applied
(`backend/scripts/migrate.sh status` lists pending ones).

## Port 54322 is already allocated

Another local Postgres is using Mike's default host port.
Stop that stack or choose another mapping, for example:

```bash
DB_PORT=54323 docker compose up --build
```

## The model picker reports a missing key

Add a key under **Settings > API Keys**, or configure it in
`backend/.env` and restart the backend.

For local Ollama models, confirm `ollama list` shows an installed model and the
backend can reach the URL configured by `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`. Refresh Mike after
installing a model.

## CourtListener tools are unavailable

See [CourtListener integration](courtlistener.md#troubleshooting) for API-token
and optional bulk-data checks.

## DOC or DOCX conversion fails

Install LibreOffice and restart the backend so its conversion command is
available on the process path.

## Sentry receives no events

- The backend logs `[sentry] enabled for api` at boot when reporting is active.
  An unset custom `SENTRY_DSN` uses Mike's built-in community DSN; only
  `SENTRY_DISABLED=true` (or the automatic test-process guard) disables it.
- The browser bundle also uses the built-in DSN when no custom
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` is set. Only `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DISABLED=true`
  disables reporting. Rebuild after changing either build-time value
  (`FRONTEND_SENTRY_DSN` / `FRONTEND_SENTRY_DISABLED` for the compose image).
- Prove the pipeline with `SENTRY_ENABLE_TEST_ROUTE=true` and
  `curl -i http://localhost:3001/observability/sentry-test`, or run the local
  sink in `scripts/sentry-sink.mjs`. Details in [observability.md](observability.md).

## Useful checks

```bash
npm run build --prefix backend
npm run build --prefix frontend
npm run lint --prefix frontend
```
