/**
 * E2E config for the Mike Word add-in.
 *
 * SERVE STRATEGY: We build the add-in for production (`build:e2e`, with fixed
 * REACT_APP_* values so route globs are predictable) and static-serve `dist/`
 * over PLAIN HTTP on a fixed port. We deliberately avoid the webpack dev server:
 * it serves over self-signed HTTPS (office-addin-dev-certs) which can prompt for
 * a keychain password and flake in CI. A static HTTP server is hermetic and
 * deterministic; the Office.js globals are provided by an in-page shim
 * (see e2e/support/office-mock.ts), so nothing here needs the real Office host.
 *
 * Tests are fully hermetic — every backend call is intercepted with page.route
 * inside the shared fixture; no live API or auth server is ever contacted.
