# Mike Word Add-in

The Mike Word add-in brings document-aware chat, workflows, quick actions, and
tracked-edit review into a Word task pane.

It uses the same backend-managed HttpOnly cookie session, Mike API, model
providers, and workflow library as the web app. Word conversations are stored
separately from the web assistant's chat history.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 or newer
- Microsoft Word desktop or Word on the web
- A running Mike backend, Postgres and GoTrue configured according to the
  [local development guide](../docs/local-development.md)
- A Mike account
- A model-provider API key or an Ollama model reachable by the backend

## Quick start

With the backend running and configured, run from the repository root:

```bash
bash word-addin/scripts/dev.sh
```

The script installs dependencies, creates `word-addin/.env`, installs the local
HTTPS certificate, verifies Mike, and launches the add-in in Word
unless automatic sideloading is disabled. It is safe to run repeatedly.

The first certificate installation may request your keychain or administrator
password. Fully quit Word and rerun the script afterward so Word reloads the
certificate trust.

Useful options:

```bash
bash word-addin/scripts/dev.sh --setup-only
FORCE=1 bash word-addin/scripts/dev.sh
```

`--setup-only` prepares the environment without launching Word. `FORCE=1`
launches even when the backend health check fails.

For normal development, start webpack directly in the foreground without
opening or sideloading Word:

```bash
bun dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Use `npm start` when you explicitly want automatic sideloading. The
`WORD_ADDIN_SIDELOAD` switch applies only to `npm start` and `scripts/dev.sh`.

## What it supports

- Chat about the open Word document with streamed responses
- Attach Mike library documents and assistant workflows
- Choose from the same supported model providers as the web app
- Apply suggested revisions as tracked changes, then accept or reject them
- Run configurable quick actions such as Proofread and Compare documents
- Create and edit assistant workflows
- Store chat history in Mike Cloud or on the current device only

The add-in requires `WordApi 1.6` for tracked-change review.

## Commands

Run commands from `word-addin/` unless noted otherwise.

| Command                    | Purpose                                                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev` / `bun dev`  | Start webpack in the foreground without sideloading Word            |
| `npm start`                | Start the HTTPS dev server; sideload unless `WORD_ADDIN_SIDELOAD=0` |
| `npm run stop`             | Stop the sideloaded development session                             |
| `npm run dev:server`       | Internal alias for starting webpack without launching Word          |
| `npm run typecheck`        | Check application and E2E TypeScript                                |
| `npm run build:e2e`        | Build with the hermetic test environment                            |
| `npm run test:e2e`         | Run the mocked Office.js Playwright suite                           |
| `npm run build`            | Create a production bundle and rewritten manifest                   |
| `npm run start:production` | Serve `dist/` and proxy `/api` using `WORD_ADDIN_BACKEND_ORIGIN`    |

## Manual sideloading

The quick-start script is the recommended development path. If automatic
sideloading fails:

- **Word desktop on macOS:** copy `manifest.xml` into
  `~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Word/Data/Documents/wef/`, restart Word,
  then open **Insert → Add-ins → My Add-ins → Mike**.
- **Word on the web:** open **Insert → Add-ins → Upload My Add-in** and select
  `manifest.xml`. Browser local-network protections can block localhost panes;
  use the included `e2e-live/manual-session.mjs` launcher when needed.
