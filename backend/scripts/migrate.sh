# Apply backend/migrations/ to an existing database, recording each file in
# the public.schema_migrations ledger so the database itself knows which
# migrations it has run.
#
# Usage:
#   DATABASE_URL=postgres://... backend/scripts/migrate.sh <command>
#
# Commands:
#   status          List pending migrations. Exits 0 when the database is up
#                   to date and 2 when files are pending.
#   up              Apply every pending migration in filename order, stopping
#                   at the first failure. Each file runs in one transaction
#                   with its ledger row, unless it cannot (see
#                   runs_in_transaction below).
#   baseline FILE   Record FILE and every migration that sorts before it as
#                   applied, without running them. Run once to adopt the
#                   ledger on a deployment upgraded by hand: FILE is the last
#                   migration it applied. Creates the ledger table if needed.
#   mark FILE       Record one migration as applied without running it, for
#                   a file applied by hand (for example in the SQL editor).
#
# Environment:
#   DATABASE_URL    Connection string for a role that owns the public schema
#                   (on Supabase, the `postgres` direct or session-pooler URL).
#   MIGRATIONS_DIR  Defaults to backend/migrations beside this script.
#   MIGRATE_LOCK_WAIT  Seconds to wait for another run's lock before giving
#                   up (default 900).
#
# Fresh installs do not need this script: schema.sql creates the ledger with
# every migration it already contains recorded. Runs against one database
# queue on an advisory lock, so a second `up` waits for the first and then
# skips what it applied. Needs bash 3.2+ and psql 10+.
