//
//   node dist/worker.js            (prod)
//   npx tsx src/worker.ts          (dev)
//
// Pair it with WORKERS_MODE=none on the API process so work runs exactly
// once. Scale-out is safe by construction: BullMQ partitions work per
// connection, and the DB queue's claim is FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED — N worker
// processes divide the jobs, never duplicate them.

// Load backend/.env before anything reads process.env, exactly like the API
// entrypoint does (app.ts's first import). Without this, `node dist/worker.js`
// on a bare-metal install — where configuration lives in .env, not in a
// container's environment block — boots without its database and auth
// configuration. Compose deployments never noticed because compose injects
// real environment variables.
// instrument.ts loads dotenv itself and must precede every other import so
// Sentry can hook the HTTP client and queue libraries this process uses.

// Postgres mode (the default) nothing does, and `node dist/worker.js` starts
// the runner, logs that it is running, and exits within half a second.
