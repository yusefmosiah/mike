/**
 * Server-owned assistant turns.
 *
 * A turn is the generation of one assistant answer. Before this module the
 * generation lived inside the HTTP response that requested it: the SSE
 * socket closing (a refresh, a closed tab, a dropped connection) aborted the
 * model call, and the backend persisted whatever had arrived as "Cancelled by
 * user." Now the turn is a *run* registered in `streamRuns.ts`, the generic
 * registry tabular generation uses as well. The route still drives the
 * generation, but it writes frames into the run's buffer instead of the
 * socket, and any number of responses can attach to the run: the original
 * request, a reload of the same chat, a second tab. A response attaching late
 * gets the buffered frames replayed from the sequence number it last saw,
 * then tails the live ones. Closing a response detaches it and nothing else;
 * only `stop()` (the explicit Stop endpoint) aborts the generation.
 *
 * This file is the chat-shaped view of a run: the key is `<surface>:<chatId>`
 * (so a chat may have one turn at a time), and the assistant row the answer
 * is stored in travels in the run's `meta`. Everything else — the frame
 * buffer, the `id:` sequence numbers, the retention and lifetime windows, the
 * SSE attachment — lives in `streamRuns.ts`.
