// Redis delivery is best-effort everywhere in this codebase: the db_jobs row is
// the durable record and the poller is the backstop. That contract only holds
// if a producer command against a DEAD Redis actually fails — with the worker
// connection options (maxRetriesPerRequest: null, offline queue on) it instead
// buffers, BullMQ's own waitUntilReady never resolves, and the enqueue promise
// never settles. The caller's try/catch cannot fire on a promise that never
// settles, so the HTTP request that was "best-effort enqueuing" simply hangs.
//
// These tests dial a port with nothing on it. Without a deadline they hang
// until vitest's own timeout; with one they reject promptly.
