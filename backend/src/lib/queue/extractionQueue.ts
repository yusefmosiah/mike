 * processes columns that are not already `done`.

 * no healthy run is in play. What it reaps is the wreckage of a LAPSED one: a
 * generation whose worker died or stalled past its lease can leave orphan jobs
 * behind in Redis, and those would otherwise re-fill the row moments after the
 * user blanked it.
 *
 * - waiting/delayed jobs are REMOVED — they never (re)start, so the cleared
 *   cells stay cleared.
 * - an active (zombie) job cannot be stopped mid-run, and Job#discard() is only
 *   an in-memory flag on the worker's OWN instance — useless from this process.
 *   Instead the job's data is marked `canceled: true` via updateData(), which
 *   IS persisted: the next attempt re-fetches job data from Redis, sees the
 *   marker in runExtractionJob, and returns without re-claiming the cleared
 *   cells — dropping its generation stamp so the stale lease is released.
 *   The in-flight attempt's terminal writes are already dead: clear-cells
 *   nulls the cells' generation_id, and those writes are guarded on it.
 *
 * Every failure is swallowed per job: cancellation is an optimization on top
 * of the generation guards, never a correctness dependency.
