/**
 * Server-owned streaming runs.
 *
 * A *run* is a unit of generation the server owns rather than the HTTP
 * response that asked for it. Before this module existed, generation lived
 * inside its request: the SSE socket closing (a refresh, a closed tab, a
 * dropped connection) aborted the work. Now the route registers a run, writes
 * frames into the run's buffer instead of the socket, and any number of
 * responses attach to it: the original request, a reload, a second tab. A
 * response attaching late gets the buffered frames replayed from the sequence
 * number it last saw, then tails the live ones. Closing a response detaches it
 * and nothing else; only `stop()` (an explicit Stop endpoint) aborts the work.
 *
 * Frames keep their wire form (`data: <json>\n\n`) and gain an SSE `id:` line
 * carrying the sequence number, which is what a client sends back as `from`
 * when it reconnects.
 *
 * A run is identified two ways: by `id` (what a client resumes) and by `key`
 * (what may only have one run at a time — `chat:<chatId>` for an assistant
 * turn, `review:<reviewId>` for a tabular generation). The surface that owns
 * the run keeps its own state in the opaque `meta` object.
 *
 * Scope: one process. A run lives in this process's memory, so a resume has to
 * reach the replica that is generating (single replica, or sticky routing). A
 * finished run is kept for a short grace period so a client that reconnects
 * just after the end still receives the terminal frames.
