// Boot-time proof that the document-lifecycle migration is applied.
//
// Rollouts run code and migrations at different moments, and this subsystem is
// asymmetric about which order is safe. Migration first is merely untidy: an
// older runner meets a job kind it does not know, fails the row, and the
// claim's backoff keeps it polite until the new code arrives. Code first is
// destructive in a way nothing reports: deletes still succeed, because the
// rows go through ordinary DELETEs — but the trigger that records WHERE the
// bytes live does not exist yet, so nothing is ever enqueued and the objects
// are orphaned with no record that they were meant to go. Uploads and edits
// 500 at the same time (PGRST202 on the lifecycle RPCs), which looks like an
// unrelated outage.
//
// So: ask the database once, at boot, whether the contract is installed, and
// refuse to serve if it is not. The check is a single cheap RPC.
