// stop acknowledging work nothing will run: account deletion falls back to
// the inline cascade, async exports answer 503. "Enqueue anyway and let it
// wait" was the old reading, and it let a 204 stand for an erasure that
// never happened. Split worker topology is WORKERS_MODE=none, not this
// flag. Polling a partial index every few seconds costs one cheap indexed
// query, and FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED in the claim RPC makes any number of
// backend replicas partition the work safely.
