 * reply, so when both fail the same way (rejected key, no credit, an outage)
 * the reply's report already covers it and a second report only duplicated
 * it (MIKE-BACKEND-D). But the title may run on a different model or
 * provider (titleModelForChat accepts an override), and even the same
 * provider can refuse the short title call alone (a rate limit), so a title
 * failure the reply did NOT share is reported once, as a warning, under its
 * own component. Anything that is not a provider or configuration failure —
 * a failed title write, a bug — still logs at error level, because nothing
 * else will report it.
