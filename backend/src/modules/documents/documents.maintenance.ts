// documentMaintenance — implementation behind the module facade.
// Stale-work reaper: flips transient statuses that lost their owner to a
// terminal "error" so the UI never shows an eternal spinner.
//
// Transient statuses ("processing" documents, "generating" tabular cells) are
// normally resolved by the request that set them or by a queue worker. A crash
// in the wrong window strands them: the request died mid-pipeline, or a job
// was lost between the status write and the enqueue. Nothing else ever
// resolves them — this sweep is the missing owner of last resort.
//
// Safety model:
// - Documents are age-gated on updated_at (STALE_DOC_PROCESSING_MS, default
//   30 min) so an in-flight synchronous upload is never touched, and — when
//   the conversion queue is enabled — a document whose conversion job still
//   exists in the queue is skipped regardless of age.
// - Cells have no updated_at column, so their sweep runs ONLY when the
//   extraction queue is enabled, where "generating with no live job" is
//   sufficient evidence of orphanhood (sync-mode in-flight work cannot be
//   distinguished from a stranded cell without an age signal, so sync
//   deployments keep today's behavior: a stuck cell is fixed by re-clicking).
// - A cell is additionally protected by its review's GENERATION LEASE: while
//   the review still holds an unexpired lease, some holder (the request that
//   claimed it, or a worker renewing it) is alive by definition and owns the
//   cell's terminal state. Only a review whose lease lapsed — or was never
//   held — can have orphans. That also closes the window between the route
//   stamping a cell and its enqueue landing in Redis, where no job exists yet.
// - Flipping a cell goes through `finalizeCell`, the one guarded terminal
//   writer: it clears `generation_id`, and for a stamped cell it matches only
//   while the cell still carries that stamp. Clearing the stamp is also what
//   lets the dead run's lease go, so the sweep calls `finishGenerationIfIdle`
//   once per generation it touched.
