/**
 * Precompute a legacy Office version's plain text into the read_document
 * cache.
 *
 * WHY: .doc and .ppt have no in-process reader, so read_document shells out
 * to LibreOffice on EVERY call — inside the chat tool call the user is
 * waiting on. Doing it once here, off the request path, turns that into a
 * single storage GET.
 *
 * Idempotent: the key is derived from the immutable version id, so a retry
 * overwrites its own object with identical bytes.
 *
 * Returns an `ocr_pending` note when the extracted text still contains pages
 * the extractor could not read (scanned pages it marked as OCR pending): the
 * cache is the only place that knows, and the job row is what an operator
 * looks at.
