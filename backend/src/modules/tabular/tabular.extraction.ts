 * Extract every not-yet-`done` column for one (review, row) pair.

 * This is the async counterpart of the inline loop that used to live in the
 * POST /:reviewId/generate handler — pulled into a standalone, dependency-
 * injected function so it can run on a worker and be unit-tested without a live
 * queue/Redis.
 *
 * Idempotent + retry-safe: it re-reads current cell state and only processes
 * columns that are not already `done` with content. A retry therefore narrows
 * to the columns still outstanding. If any targeted column fails to come back
 * from the model, the function THROWS so BullMQ retries the job; the permanent-
 * failure handler (below) is what finally marks stragglers `error`.
 *
 * LEASE. The request that enqueued this job claimed the review's generation
 * lease and then handed it over — it cannot hold it, because the work outlives
 * the request. So each running job renews the lease on a heartbeat, and the job
 * that clears the last generation stamp releases it. Cells still queued keep
 * their stamp, so the lease is never released while work remains.
