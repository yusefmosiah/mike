/**
 * Configurable database stub shared by the route integration suites.
 *
 * Every suite that imports `../../app` loads *every* router, so each one needs
 * the same fake `createDb()`. The stub used to be copy-pasted
 * byte-for-byte into projects.routes.test.ts, tabular.routes.test.ts and
 * workflows.routes.test.ts; a fix to one copy (say, a newly-used PostgREST
 * filter method) silently left the other two behind.
 *
 * How it works: `dbState` is seeded per-test in `beforeEach`; terminal
 * query operations (.single() / .maybeSingle() / awaiting the thenable builder)
 * resolve to the per-table result, and rpc() resolves to `dbState.rpc`.
 * Insert payloads are recorded so tests can assert on what got persisted
 * (normalisation, lowercasing, dedupe), and `operations` / `rpcCalls` record
 * the order a route touched tables and RPCs in — the tabular suites assert on
 * that ordering to pin the generation-lease protocol (claim the lease before
 * reading rows, release it last).
 *
 * Usage — note that `vi.mock` factories are hoisted above imports, so the
 * factory must pull the helper in dynamically rather than closing over a
 * top-level import binding:
 *
 *     import { dbState, resetDbState, mockDb } from "../helpers/dbMock";
 *
 *     vi.mock("../../lib/db", async () => {
 *         const { mockDb } = await import("../helpers/dbMock");
 *         return { createDb: vi.fn(() => mockDb()) };
 *     });
 *
 * The dynamic import inside the factory and the static import at the top of the
 * suite resolve to the same module instance, so the state object the tests
 * mutate is the one the stub reads. Vitest isolates modules per test file, so
 * the module-level state is per-suite, not shared across files.
