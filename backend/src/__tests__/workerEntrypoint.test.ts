// `node dist/worker.js` is the documented standalone-worker topology
// (WORKERS_MODE=none on the API, workers on their own container). Everything
// startAllWorkers() creates is deliberately unref'd — it has to be, because
// the same code runs inside the API process — and a signal handler is not a
// handle, so without one ref'd handle of its own the entrypoint starts the
// runner, logs "running", and exits immediately. In Redis mode BullMQ's open
// sockets hide this; in Postgres mode (the default transport) nothing does.
//
// This spawns the real entrypoint against an auth URL that does not answer
// — the runner logs claim failures and keeps polling, which is exactly the
// behaviour under test — and asserts it is still alive a second later.

// the CLI alone leaves a real polling worker orphaned after every test run.
