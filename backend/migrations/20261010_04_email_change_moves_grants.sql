-- Move email-keyed access grants with the account when its email changes.
--
-- project_access_grants, chat_access_grants, tabular_review_access_grants and
-- workflow_shares are keyed by normalized email. handle_user_email_updated
-- used to update only the user_profiles mirror, so a confirmed address change
-- stranded every direct grant on the old address: the person lost their
-- shares, and whoever registered the old address next inherited them.
--
-- Safe to re-run: create or replace plus drop-before-create of the trigger.
